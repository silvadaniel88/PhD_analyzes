# PhD_analyzes
 R scripts used to analyze data in my PhD studies

LAI_drivers: I use SEM aproach to understand environmental drivers of LAI. SEM was performed using the 'piecewiseSEM' package.

Biomass_biodiversity: in this script I test the relationship of biomass stock and production and species richness and composition. Includes model selection and dashboard.
